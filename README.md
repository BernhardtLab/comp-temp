# Data and code for Davis et al., General predictions for the effects of warming on competition



Overview of the repo goes here

Here we incorporate temperature dependence into a Macarthur consumer-resource model and then use simulation to investigate the effects of this on competitive dynamics. We incorporate temeprature dependence by adding empirically-derived temperature-sensitivity estimates for each mechanistic process in the CR model.
